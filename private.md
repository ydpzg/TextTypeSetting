The TextTypeSetting add-on does not collect or distribute any information about you or about the documents being converted.

Required permissions:

TextTypeSetting will ask for permission to access the current Doc (to convert it). TextTypeSetting reads the Doc content and structure; it does not change any content.

TextTypeSetting will also ask for permission to display a sidebar. It uses the sidebar to display action buttons and option checkboxes as well as the converted text.

It requires no other permissions.
